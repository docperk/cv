          I have been in IT support for almost 22 years. I started as a helpdesk agent for Sabre supporting the American Airlines customer in Oct of 1997. At this tiume Sabre was under the umbrellas of AMR same as AA. I moved up and became expert in several diferent fields and then was promoted to the SPOC group or second level agent for a specialized group supporting the Sabre customer.  Sabre split from AMR and became it's own company.  A couple of yerars later it split and sold the IT portion of the company to EDS.  Our SPOC group took on a new role and became RDM, Remote Desktop Support.  A few years later EDS was sold to HP.  HP slit into 2 companys and the IT portion became HPE.  About the time that HPE was merging with DXC AA insourced our group and a few other groups in the IT group we worked with.
